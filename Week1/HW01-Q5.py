# Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer-prize-winning book, GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach, poses the following mathematical puzzle.
#
# Pick a positive integer n as the start.
# If n is even, divide it by 2.
# If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
# Continue this process until n is 1.

        if n%2==0:
            n = n/2

            n = 3*n+1
        count = count+1
    return count
